1) error handling: not enough credits crashes app --OK

2) pressing follow button on user's homepage adds the followee name to followee's followers list
  [figure out backend mess]

3) ribbits do not affect order of items in timeline as supposed 
  [sorting should be done on front end, pass rank as prop]

how to sort posts on front end: normalize by ribbits:
1/n is most rated, 2/n is second most etc, where n is total
posts. sort array, use by ribbits, use posts index+1.

timeline mount does not put posts in order
first rib works to change to intended order,
subsequent ribs do not. Redo whole system
