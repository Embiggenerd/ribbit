# ribbit

An original social network in react/node. Uses reading hours, purchased credits, and "ribbits" to compete for users' attention.

## In Detail:
* An author's total reading hours affect the visibility of his posts in his followers timeline positively.
* Age of a post affects a post negatively.
* Credits are earned per reading hours, or per dollar as purchased using stripe.
* You can spend credits to Ribbit posts, which lowers their visibility.
* Ribbits are essentially dislikes that have a negative impact on a user's competition, and must be earned or bought.
* Credits can be transfered from user to user.

## Demonstrates
* React, redux, react-router.
